# Clima
The simple weather app.

## Backstory
I've been struggling a fair bit recently with motivation to code and more specifically start a big project that I know I won't finish. So, I'm starting to give myself just 1 hour to build something. Whether it is good, or bad, I'll be posting all my challenge results here on my GitHub. I'm also hoping to learn one or two new skills in doing this and also re-capping some subjects I've not covered in a while.

### Todo
I'm hoping to come back and revisit this project for 30 minutes in the near future. Or if you fancy contributing, feel free and ping me a PR with the time you spent on it.
* Tests
* Algolia Places Intergration
* Background Changing Dependant On Temprature
* Sleeker Design 

## Project setup
```bash
yarn install
yarn serve
```
You will also need to get an API key from the Open Weather API and create a .env for this.
